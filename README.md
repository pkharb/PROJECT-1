README

TECHNOLOGIES USED :-
- HTML/CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- JQUERY

YOUR APPROACH :-
- i spent too much time on CSS and kept the JQuery part for the end, but because of the mistake i made with github branching, i ended up spending a lot of time salving my project. It was very frustrating and caused a lot of stress. As a result, i could not spend as much time on jquery as i had planned. 

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS :-
- submit button styling
- my slider is still has a few glitches

BIGGEST WINS AND CHALLENGES :-
- The mistake with github became my biggest challenge
